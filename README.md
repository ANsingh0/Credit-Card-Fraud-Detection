# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
### Context 
According to the Nilson Report's Global Card Fraud report for 2021, global losses due to credit card fraud reached $27.85 billion in 2020, and this number is projected to increase in the coming years. These losses are borne by banks and financial institutions, as well as cardholders who may be liable for unauthorized charges.Credit card fraud detection is therefore critical for banks and financial institutions to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions in real-time.

### Dataset 
I used Kaggle Credit Card Fraud dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

### Model Prediction
### Step 1
importing libraries. I have used Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn
### Step 2
Exploratory Data Analysis - Data pre-processing and Data Visualisation
(Dataset is very unbalanced)
### Step 3
Under Sampling(treating unbalanced data) and Concatenating new dataframes
### Step 4 
Spliting the data into training and test dataset
### Step 5 
Model Training- Logistic Regression Algorithm
Model Evaluation- Accuracy Score

### Conclusion
This credit card fraud detection machine learning project has been successful in achieving an accuracy score of 0.91 on the test dataset.We can also use complex anomaly detection models to get better accuracy in determining more fraudulent cases. With the increasing prevalence of digital payments and e-commerce, it is critical for financial institutions and businesses to implement effective fraud detection and prevention strategies. The project serves as a promising step towards achieving this goal and highlights the potential for further advancements in the field.
